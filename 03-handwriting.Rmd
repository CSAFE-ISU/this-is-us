# Project G: Handwriting (& Signatures)

<p class="new"> The handwriting project has three major focuses:  <p>

  1. data collection
  2. computational tools
  3. closed-set writer modeling
  4. communication of results

## Data Collection
<p class="new"> Data collection is underway with the most recent update at:  <p>

  - 44 participants complete through session #3
  - 52 participants complete through session #2
  - 10 participants complete through session #1
  
## Computational Tools
<p class="new"> The <i> handwriter R package<i> is our major computational tool for the project. Currently we are making efforts to integrate the glyph cluster template into the package. <p> 

## Closed-Set Writer Modeling
<p class="new"> The following will be the jumping off point for purposes of this book with respect to modelling and discussion of results.<p>
