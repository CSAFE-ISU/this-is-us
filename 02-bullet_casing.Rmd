# Project CC: Bullets and Cartridge Cases {#bullets}

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE)
```

For both bullets and cartridge cases we are dealing with several inter-related aspects, that we want to address independently. 

Those are:

1. data collection
2. computational tools
3. similarity scores

    1. for bullet lands: 

        a. crosscut identification
        b. groove location
        c. curvature removal
        d. alignment of signatures
        e. feature extraction
        f. matching with trained Random Forest

    2. for breech faces

4. analysis of results
5. communication of results and methods


## Data Collection

### LAPD

All bullets are collected by Srinivasan Rathinam, LAPD. 

#### Main study
4 bullets per barrel for  626  Beretta 92 F/FS firearms , ammunition used are 9 mm Luger Winchester 115 grain with a Copper surface.

scans are on Raven.

<p class="new">evaluation: Yawei is going to work through all 626 barrels of knowns to assess similarity scores</p>

```{r, fig.cap="Results from assessing scans of barrel FAU 1 similarity.", out.width="50%", fig.keep="hold", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(c("images/yawei/results-FAU-1.png"))
```

```{r, fig.cap="Results from assessing scans of barrel FAU 2 similarity.", out.width="50%", fig.keep="hold", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(c( "images/yawei/results-FAU-2.png"))
```

#### follow-up study 

4 bullets per barrel for  96 of the original 626 Beretta firearms using different ammunition

<p class = "new">bullets are being scanned</p>

### Hamby Sets

Scans for Hamby Sets 10, 36, 44, and 224

Scans for 3 replicates of clones for Hamby 224

### Houston Tests

contact: Melissa Nally, Houston FSI

pre-study: 3 kits with 25 bullets each 

study: 4 kits with X bullets each


### Houston Persistence

contact: Melissa Nally, Houston FSI

8 barrels with 40 fired bullets each

### St Louis persistence

contact: Steve Kramer, St Louis PD

2 barrels with 192 fired bullets each (2 bullets collected every 25 shots)


### DFSC Cartridge cases

Breech face data for knowns are scanned and available on a private github repository

evaluation

## Computational Tools

### x3ptools

`x3ptools` is an R package for working with files in x3p format. x3p is an ISO standard for describing 3d topographic surface measurements. 
`x3ptools` is available on CRAN, i.e. can be installed with the command `install.packages("x3ptools")`. The development version is available from github. Installation instructions and basic usage can be found at https://heike.github.io/x3ptools/


### bulletxtrctr

`bulletxtrctr` is a developmental R package available from github (see https://heike.github.io/bulletxtrctr/) that allows an assessment of similarity scores using the data extraction pipeline described in @hare. 

### grooveFinder

`grooveFinder` is a developmental R package providing different methods for identifying the location of grooves in scans of bullets.
Installation instructions and some basic usage can be found at https://heike.github.io/grooveFinder/
