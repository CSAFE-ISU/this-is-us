# Prerequisites

This project is a hugely collaborative effort across a large number of
individuals. In order to avoid (technical) conflicts between
contributions and contributors, we all need to follow a set of
guidelines.

## Setting up the repository on your machine

1.  *Git and Github*: git has to be installed on your machine
    ([instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)).
    Create a *free* Github account at <https://github.com/>. Most likely
    you qualify for one of their [educational
    discounts](https://education.github.com/). You can always upgrade
    your account at a later date, when you have a better idea of what
    the benefits mean.
2.  Become a member of the [csafe-isu github
    organization](https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU). For that send email
    with your github handle (the login you have just created) to hofmann
    at iastate dot edu. Dr Hofmann will then give you access to the
    organization.
3.  Create a local copy of the [this-is-us
    repository](https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU/this-is-us) on your
    machine:

Step 0: Copy the text underneath the green button on the right hand
side: ![](images/setup/00_copy-github.png) Step 1: Open RStudio and
create a new project: New Project \> Version Control \> Git
![](images/setup/00_create-project.png)
![](images/setup/01_create-project.png) Now paste the text from the
clipboard into the url: ![](images/setup/02_create-project.png)

Once you hit the button 'Create Project' all of the files from the
'this-is-us' repository are being downloaded. Depending on your internet
connection this takes a few moments.

4.  And finally, the RStudio project opens in your local this-is-us
    folder:

![](images/setup/04_create-project.png)

I am assuming that you have set up git in Rstudio. If not, read the
start of Jenny Bryan's chapter [Can you hear me
now?](https://happygitwithr.com/connect-intro.html) of her book "Happy
Git with R".

Run the following three lines of R in the console:

    if (!require(usethis)) install.packages(usethis) # installs usethis package if needed
    usethis::git_vaccinate() # this command creates the file .gitignore
    usethis::use_git_ignore(ignores=c(".gitignore", "docs-local", "_bookdown_files/"))

The `git_vaccinate()` command creates a (global) file called .gitignore
that prevents you from accidentally sharing personal credentials stored
in files `.DS`, `.Rproj.user`, and `.Rhistory`.

Additionally, we set up your system to ignore any of your locally
created files - this will minimize the number of conflicts between us :)

Now you are ready to make some changes!

## Contributions to the repository

Everybody is expected to add a summary of their work since the last
show-and tell meeting. Think of this write-up as our joint lab book,
that is organized by topic rather than chronologically.

The mechanism to work with any github repository is `pull` - `commit` -
`pull` - `push`. When you are working collaboratively make sure that you
commit and push often to avoid conflicts with your collaborators.

1.  *pull*: once RStudio has been set up properly, you will have an
    additional tab in your environment pane called `Git`. The bluish
    downwards arrow is a shortcut for a pull. Click it and make sure
    that you don't get an error message.

2.  *build*: Once everything is pulled, build the book by first
    selecting the tab `Build` and then hitting the `Build Book` hammer.

3.  make changes: work in your changes summarizing the work you have
    done since the last show and tell. Abstain from writing a novel - go
    for succinct and precise :) We are using Rmarkdown to write. There
    are plenty of resources for learning/brushing up on your Rmarkdown
    skills, e.g.:

    -   [cheatsheet with Rmarkdown
        commands](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
    -   Rstudio's [tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

4.  including figures: our work revolves around pattern evidence, so it
    is quite natural to include figures and graphs. There is a folder
    called `images` in the repo, within that each area has a subfolder.
    Pick the one that best describes your work. Create a folder with
    your name or your project's name. All of your figures should live
    inside that. Use the *local* path to your images, i.e. I would
    include my file `image.png` as `images/bullets/heike/image.png`.
    Image files should be either PNGs (png) or JPEGs (extension jpg or
    jpeg). PDF files as images will not show up on the websites.

5.  *build*: Make sure that your changes don't introduce any technical
    problems. Also spellcheck your work. The html is living online,
    openly visible. Documents with lots of typos don't show us at our
    best.

6.  *commit*: commits are git's way of saving things. Try to be as
    specific in your commit message as you can.
    `Heike's changes for the show and tell on May 21` might be a correct
    message, but are completely void of information two months later,
    because the commit message is also dated. A commit message of
    `description of general work process for this-is-us repo` is much
    more helpful.

7.  check that you have added all the *figures* or any other new files.
    Clicking on the checkmark in front of file in the Git panel will
    change the Status icon to a red A indicating that a file has been
    added. Be careful with this power, files that have been pushed
    online can practically never be taken back. So DO NOT ADD DATA
    before double checking with your PI. Do not add passwords, credit
    card information, or other personal information.

8.  *pull-push*: move your changes online by pushing. In order to make
    sure that you incorporate all the changes that collaborators have
    made since you have pulled your changes last (in 1), update your
    document with another `pull` first. Once that has successfully
    happened, `push` your changes to the repo by clicking on the
    greenish upwards arrow in the Git tab.

9.  Rinse and repeat 1-8.

While it looks like a long shopping list of things to remember, once you
have gone through the cycle a few times, you will find that it becomes
second nature.

Welcome on board the CSAFE ship :)
