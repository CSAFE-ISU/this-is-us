Those are: data collection computational tools similarity scores for bullet lands: crosscut identification groove location curvature removal alignment of signatures feature extraction matching with trained Random Forest for breech faces analysis of results communication of results and methods 3.1 Data Collection 3.1.1 LAPD All bullets are collected by Srinivasan Rathinam, LAPD. 3.1.1.1 Main study 4 bullets per barrel for 626 Beretta 92 F/FS firearms , ammunition used are 9 mm Luger Winchester 115 grain with a Copper surface. scans are on Raven evaluation: Yawei is going to work through all 626 barrels of knowns to assess similarity scores Figure 3.1: Results from assessing scans of barrels FAU 1 and FAU 2 for similarity. Figure 3.2: Results from assessing scans of barrels FAU 1 and FAU 2 for similarity. 3.1.1.2 follow-up study 4 bullets per barrel for 96 of the original 626 Beretta firearms using different ammunition bullets are being scanned 3.1.2 Hamby Sets Scans for Hamby Sets 10, 36, 44, and 224 Scans for 3 replicates of clones for Hamby 224 3.1.3 Houston Tests contact: Melissa Nally, Houston FSI pre-study: 3 kits with 25 bullets each study: 4 kits with X bullets each 3.1.4 Houston Persistence contact: Melissa Nally, Houston FSI 8 barrels with 40 fired bullets each 3.1.5 St Louis persistence contact: Steve Kramer, St Louis PD 2 barrels with 192 fired bullets each (2 bullets collected every 25 shots) 3.1.6 DFSC Cartridge cases Breech face data for knowns are scanned and available on a private github repository evaluation 3.2 Computational Tools 3.2.1 x3ptools x3ptools is an R package for working with files in x3p format. x3p is an ISO standard for describing 3d topographic surface measurements. x3ptools is available on CRAN, i.e. can be installed with the command install.packages(\"x3ptools\"). The development version is available from github. Installation instructions and basic usage can be found at https://heike.github.io/x3ptools/ 3.2.2 bulletxtrctr bulletxtrctr is a developmental R package available from github (see https://heike.github.io/bulletxtrctr/) that allows an assessment of similarity scores using the data extraction pipeline described in Hare, Hofmann, and Carriquiry (2017). 3.2.3 grooveFinder grooveFinder is a developmental R package providing different methods for identifying the location of grooves in scans of bullets. Installation instructions and some basic usage can be found at https://heike.github.io/grooveFinder/ 3.3 Similarity Scores 3.3.1 Bullet Lands 3.3.1.1 Approaches to identify groove locations 3.3.2 Cartridge Cases 3.4 Analysis of Results 3.5 Communication of Results and Methods 3.6 People involved 3.6.1 Faculty Heike Hofmann Susan VanderPlas 3.6.2 Graduate Students Ganesh Krishnan Kiegan Rice Nate Garton Charlotte Roigers Joe Zemmels Yawei Ge 3.6.3 Undergraduates Talen Fisher (fix3p) Andrew Maloney Mya Fisher, Allison Mark, Connor Hergenreter, Carley McConnell, Anyesha Ray (scanner) References "]
