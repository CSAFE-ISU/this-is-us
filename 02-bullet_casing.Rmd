# Project CC: Bullets and Cartridge Cases {#bullets}

For both bullets and cartridge cases we are dealing with several inter-related aspects, that we want to address independently. 

Those are:

1. data collection
2. computational tools
3. similarity scores

    1. for bullet lands: 

        a. crosscut identification
        b. groove location
        c. curvature removal
        d. alignment of signatures
        e. feature extraction
        f. matching with trained Random Forest

    2. for breech faces

4. analysis of results
5. communication of results and methods
