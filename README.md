Hi everybody,

in order to avoid the most egregious problems with the repository, we are going to need a couple of rules how to work with each other. We will add to these as we need more rules :)

1. run `usethis::git_vaccinate()` in your RStudio session - this will add files to your global `.gitignore` file. Those are files that should not be included in any of your github repositories (for security reasons).




This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for how to compile this example into HTML. You may generate a copy of the book in `bookdown::pdf_book` format by calling `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')`. More detailed instructions are available here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html.

You can find the preview of this example at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown-demo/.
