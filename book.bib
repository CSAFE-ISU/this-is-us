abstract = {Abstract The same-source problem remains a major challenge in forensic toolmark and firearm examination. Here, we investigate the applicability of the Chumbley method (J Forensic Sci, 2018, 63, 849; J Forensic Sci, 2010, 55, 953) (10,12), developed for screwdriver markings, for same-source identification of striations on bullet LEAs. The Hamby datasets 44 and 252 measured by NIST and CSAFE (high-resolution scans) are used here. We provide methods to identify parameters that minimize error rates for matching of LEAs, and a remedial algorithm to alleviate the problem of failed tests, while increasing the power of the test and reducing error rates. For 85,491 land-to-land comparisons (84,235 known nonmatches and 1256 known matches), the adapted test does not provide a result in 176 situations (originally more than 500). The Type I and Type II error rates are 7.2\% (6105 out of 84,235) and 21.4\% (271 out of 1256), respectively. This puts the proposed method on similar footing as other single-feature matching approaches in the literature.},

	abstract = {Most medical image registration algorithms suffer from a directionality bias that has been shown to largely impact subsequent analyses. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to address this bias in the context of nonlinear registration, but little work has been done for global registration. We propose a symmetric approach based on a block-matching technique and least-trimmed square regression. The proposed method is suitable for multimodal registration and is robust to outliers in the input images. The symmetric framework is compared with the original asymmetric block-matching technique and is shown to outperform it in terms of accuracy and robustness. The methodology presented in this article has been made available to the community as part of the NiftyReg open-source package.},
