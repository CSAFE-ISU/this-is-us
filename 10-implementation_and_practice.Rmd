# Project IMPL: Implementation and Practice {#impl}

## Demonstrative Evidence and Firearms

Project purpose

1. Examine the use of demonstrative (picture) evidence in examiner testimony
2. Develop and test language for quantitative firearms analysis testimony
3. Validate quantitative language for firearms analysis with and without demonstrative evidence

### Previous work

write up a bit of a blurb here about FRSTAT language, Brandon's studies, etc.

### Study Design

This study design is a 2x2x3 factorial. The first factor is the presence or
absence of demonstrative evidence. The second factor is the presence or absence of
the bullet matching algorithm, and the third factor is the expert's conclusion:
match, inconclusive, or not a match.
